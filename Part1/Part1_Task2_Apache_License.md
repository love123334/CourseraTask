# Part 1 Task 2: Apache 2.0 License (2 pts)

## Detailed Answer

The repository contains a comprehensive Apache License 2.0 file named "LICENSE" in the root directory. This license file was automatically generated when I selected the Apache 2.0 license option during repository creation on GitHub.

The Apache License 2.0 is an open-source software license that provides several key benefits for this project:

1. **Permissive Nature**: It allows users to use, modify, and distribute the software with minimal restrictions, which aligns perfectly with the micro-finance startup's mission to empower low-income individuals by making the simple interest calculator freely available.

2. **Commercial Use**: The license permits commercial use of the software, enabling the startup and other organizations to integrate this calculator into their financial services.

3. **Patent Protection**: The license includes patent protection clauses that protect contributors and users from patent litigation, encouraging community participation and contribution.

4. **Attribution Requirements**: While permissive, it requires proper attribution, ensuring the original authors receive credit for their work.

The LICENSE file contains the complete Apache License 2.0 text, including all terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution. This ensures legal clarity for anyone who wants to use, contribute to, or build upon this simple interest calculator project.

This licensing choice supports the project's goal of creating an open-source financial tool that can benefit communities worldwide, particularly those in need of accessible financial calculation tools.
