# Part 1 Task 1: Repository URL (2 pts)

## URL
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/github-final-project

## Detailed Answer

I have successfully created a new GitHub repository named "github-final-project" as required for this assignment. The repository is set to public visibility to ensure it's accessible to the community and follows open-source best practices. 

The repository was created with the following specifications:
- Repository name: github-final-project
- Visibility: Public
- License: Apache 2.0 (automatically added)
- README file: Included during creation

This repository serves as the foundation for hosting the simple interest calculator project and all its supporting documentation. The public visibility ensures that the community can access, contribute to, and benefit from this open-source project as intended by the micro-finance startup's mission to empower low-income individuals.

The repository URL provided above is the direct link to access the repository on GitHub, where all the project files, documentation, and code are hosted and managed.
