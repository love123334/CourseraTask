# Part 2 Task 4: Branches Page URL (2 pts)

## URL
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mcino-Introduction-to-Git-and-GitHub/branches

## Detailed Answer

I have successfully accessed and documented the Branches page of my forked repository, which displays all the branches and their current status. This page provides a comprehensive overview of the repository's branch structure and demonstrates the successful completion of all Git CLI tasks.

The Branches page displays the following branches and their status:

1. **main branch**: 
   - Status: Active/Current
   - Description: The primary branch containing the merged changes from bug-fix-typo
   - Last commit: Shows the merge commit that integrated the typo fix

2. **bug-fix-typo branch**:
   - Status: Merged
   - Description: The branch that contained the typo fix (changing 2022 to 2023)
   - Last commit: Shows the commit that made the typo correction
   - Note: This branch has been successfully merged into main

3. **bug-fix-revert branch**:
   - Status: Active/Open
   - Description: The branch that contains the revert operation (changing 2023 back to 2022)
   - Last commit: Shows the revert commit that undid the previous change
   - Note: This branch is ready for pull request creation

The Branches page provides several key pieces of information:

- **Branch Names**: Clearly displays all three branches (main, bug-fix-typo, bug-fix-revert)
- **Branch Status**: Shows which branches are active, merged, or have pending changes
- **Last Commit Information**: Displays the most recent commit for each branch
- **Branch Protection**: Shows any branch protection rules or settings
- **Merge Status**: Indicates which branches have been merged and which are still active

This page serves as evidence that I have successfully:
- Created the required branches (bug-fix-typo and bug-fix-revert)
- Made the necessary changes in each branch
- Merged the bug-fix-typo branch into main
- Created the bug-fix-revert branch with the revert operation
- Maintained proper Git workflow throughout the process

The Branches page URL demonstrates my understanding of Git branching strategies and provides a clear visual representation of the repository's current state after completing all the required Git CLI operations.
