# Part 2 Task 1: Forked Repository URL (2 pts)

## URL
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mcino-Introduction-to-Git-and-GitHub

## Detailed Answer

I have successfully forked the upstream repository "mcino-Introduction-to-Git-and-GitHub" into my personal GitHub account. The forked repository maintains all the original content from the upstream repository while creating a personal copy that I can modify and work with independently.

The forking process involved:

1. **Repository Forking**: I navigated to the original repository and clicked the "Fork" button, which created a complete copy of the repository under my GitHub account.

2. **Content Preservation**: The forked repository contains all the original files, branches, and commit history from the upstream repository, ensuring no data loss during the forking process.

3. **Independent Development**: The fork allows me to make changes, create branches, and commit modifications without affecting the original repository, following Git best practices for collaborative development.

4. **Pull Request Capability**: The fork enables me to create pull requests back to the upstream repository, allowing me to contribute my changes to the original project.

The forked repository URL provided above is the direct link to my personal copy of the repository, where I can perform all the required Git operations including:
- Creating new branches (bug-fix-typo and bug-fix-revert)
- Making modifications to files
- Committing changes
- Merging branches
- Creating pull requests

This forked repository serves as my working environment for completing all the Git CLI tasks while maintaining the ability to contribute changes back to the original project through pull requests.
