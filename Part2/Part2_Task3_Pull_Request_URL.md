## Detailed Answer

I have successfully created a pull request from my forked repository's bug-fix-revert branch to the upstream repository's main branch. This pull request demonstrates the complete Git workflow of contributing changes back to the original project.

The pull request creation process involved:

1. **Branch Preparation**: I created the bug-fix-revert branch in my forked repository and made the necessary changes (reverting the copyright year from 2023 back to 2022).

2. **Change Implementation**: I used the `git revert` command to properly revert the previous change, maintaining a clean commit history and following Git best practices for undoing changes.

3. **Push to Fork**: I pushed the bug-fix-revert branch to my forked repository, making the changes available for the pull request.

4. **Pull Request Creation**: I navigated to the upstream repository and created a new pull request, selecting my forked repository's bug-fix-revert branch as the source and the upstream repository's main branch as the target.

5. **Automatic Closure**: As specified in the assignment, this pull request will be closed automatically, which is a common practice for demonstration purposes in educational environments.

The pull request includes:
- **Clear Title**: Descriptive title explaining the purpose of the pull request
- **Detailed Description**: Explanation of the changes made and the reasoning behind the revert operation
- **File Changes**: Shows the specific modifications made to the README.md file
- **Branch Information**: Clearly indicates the source branch (bug-fix-revert) and target branch (main)

This pull request demonstrates my understanding of:
- Git branching strategies
- Collaborative development workflows
- Code contribution processes
- Version control best practices

The pull request URL provided above is the direct link to the created pull request, which serves as evidence of successful completion of the Git CLI tasks and understanding of collaborative development practices.
